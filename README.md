# iRhto_memote
Memote-created repository for Rhodosporidium toruloides genome-scale metabolic model iRhto

## Current version
iRhto1108: 03/30/2019

## Usage
As of current, gene_reaction_rule in model SBML format (.xml) file are errorneous due to a bug in cobra.io.write_sbml_model. Please use the JSON format (.json) model as the most reliable formats.

## Reference
If you use this model or associated results, please cite and reference the following article:<br>

# iRhto_memote
Memote-created repository for Rhodosporidium toruloides genome-scale metabolic model iRhto

## Current version
iRhto1108: 04/09/2019 (on release)

## Usage
Hoang Dinh, 2019-06-27<br>
Issues of GPR in SBML model (.XML) fixed.<br>
<br>
Multiple formats of the model (JSON, SBML, MATLAB, YAML, and Excel) are in "iRhto_memote/model_files". Supplementary files including details on biomass reaction, escher maps for visualization, and memote report are in "iRhto_memote/supplementary_files".<br>
<br>
The model is also available on KBase at https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/ws.42217.obj.1 (under construction).
